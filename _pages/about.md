I am a post doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins, working with DSAI and Anjalie Field. I study digital communication including social media, human/AI communication, and more from the perspectives of computational linguistics, network science, and data analysis. I received my PhD in 2025 from Cornell under Jon Kleinberg.
